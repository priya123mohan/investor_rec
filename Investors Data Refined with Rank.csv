We provide actionable insights and information to help foster understanding about the microbiome and the role it plays in health and wellness. union's mission is to transform research into useful products based on the microbiome. uBiome is the world’s first effort to map the human microbiome with citizen science. While the sequencing of the human genome has provided invaluable knowledge, it is very difficult to change their own genetic makeup. The microbiome, in contrast, is much more easily changed through simple means such as healthful probiotic cultures and other lifestyle interventions. The microbiome thus may provide some of the most important medical breakthroughs of their era. uBiome will ultimately empower participants to manage their microbiomes to improve their health as well as make important scientific discoveries for humanity.",,"Health Care, Machine Learning, Quantified Self",9/21/2018,83000000,Series C,0,0,83000000,72

Cipla's mission is to be a leading global healthcare company which uses technology and innovation to meet everyday needs of all patients.  Cipla is a global pharmaceutical company which uses cutting edge technology and innovation to meet the everyday needs of all patients. For over 80 years, Cipla has emerged as one of the most respected pharmaceutical names in India as well as across more than 100 countries. Cipla's portfolio includes over 1500 products across wide range of therapeutic categories with one quality standard globally.  Whilst delivering a long-term sustainable business, Cipla recognises its duty to provide affordable medicines. Cipla’s emphasis on access for patients was recognised globally for the pioneering role played in HIV/AIDS treatment as the first pharmaceutical company to provide a triple combination anti-retroviral (ARV) in Africa at less than a dollar a day and thereby treating many millions of patients since 2001.  Cipla's research and development focuses on developing innovative products and drug delivery systems. Cipla does not sell its products online and no guidelines for online sales are applicable.  Cipla was born out of Dr. K.A. Hamied’s vision to harness Indian expertise for self-sufficiency in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in India. Dr. K.A. Hamied was an exemplary visionary who donned various hats; he was a chemist, an entrepreneur and pioneer, an active participant in India’s independence struggle, a close ally of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Zakir Hussain and various others, a legislator in the Bombay Presidency, head of various associations, Sheriff of Bombay, proactive supporter and sponsor of institutes of scientific excellence in India.  Be it the commencement of bulk drug production in India, the landmark Indian Patents Act of 1970, the several ‘firsts’ in India and the world, its historic international stance on the price and availability of antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment in 2000-2001, its free-of-cost Palliative Care Centre for terminally-ill cancer patients, Cipla, under the leadership of its current Chairman Dr. Y.K. Hamied, has stood for fearlessness and compassion. It is not for nothing that we say ‘None Shall be Denied’.  Apart from its various national and international milestones, the story of Cipla’s growth and expansion, its ups and downs, successes and challenges is also one that deserves to be chronicled. According to Dr Y K Hamied, Cipla was ranked 56 in the 1960s.  It is with this view that the Cipla Archives project has been launched recently. We treat our proud legacy with the seriousness and the sense of responsibility it deserves. Cipla wants to share their story, celebrate its rich history, remind themselves of the lessons learned and reflect on the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry in India and at Cipla’s role in shaping it.  The Cipla Archives will bring together and house a treasure-trove of documents, photographs and oral history interviews, among other material. As the project progresses, we hope to make information available through this website. With this initiative and related activities, Cipla not only hope to showcase Cipla’s history but also contribute to the development of business archives in India and serve as a forum for debates and discussions on the history and historiography of science and the pharmaceutical industry in India.",,"Energy, Enterprise, Health Care, Health Diagnostics, Information Technology, Manufacturing, SaaS, Venture Capital",,,,0,0,0,370

PureTech Health,20,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","The Innovation Fund was created in 2007 by Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital to address a growing unmet need for funding emerging technology in the capital gap between invention and product development. The main objective of the fund is to accelerate to market technologies developed by Partners HealthCare investigators, thereby enhancing healthcare quality, cost and outcomes. Structured as a separate LLC entity, the $35M Fund is evergreen in design and will reinvest all gains from investments back into the Fund to create capital for additional investments. Investment decision oversight is provided by an independent external committee composed of experts from industry, venture capital and academia. The Fund operates on a venture capital model whereby opportunities are rigorously evaluated on the basis of scientific strength as well as potential for commercial success. The Fund has four major goals: * Capture more value from the PHS research portfolio by creating companies, technologies and solutions that advance and enhance healthcare. * Provide funding for technologies positioned in the capital gap between invention and clinical development. * By demonstrating institutional commitment, attract external capital that will leverage and encourage co-investment. * Generate a return on investment to refresh the fund and provide capital for additional technologies. Gap Funding Over the last five to seven years, the environment for early-stage investing has undergone significant change. As a result of these changes, there is a dearth of funding support for technologies/companies positioned between invention and clinical development. By focusing on this capital gap, the Fund can advance technologies of high commercial potential and medical benefit to a stage where larger, more traditional investment sources are attracted to underwrite the risk. Types of Fund Investments The Partners Innovation Fund will make two types of investments: Equity and Development. Equity investments are seed and early financings that will catalyze company formation. These investments will often be a Series A stock and co-investors are frequently other early institutional investors, private investors or corporate investment funds. Development investments precede company formation and are intended to validate technologies with a high potential for later commercialization by either new venture formation or out-licensing to an existing market player. For all investments, funds will be reserved for participation in follow-on investments. Innovation Fund Process Utilizing a proven venture capital based diligence model, the team conducts in-depth diligence on all opportunities in two steps: 1. Initial Screening: Assesses opportunities for high commercial potential. Key project attributes are: * Product concept and value proposition * Intellectual Property Position * Stage of technology development * Market Opportunity * Technology Review * Management Team * Regulatory pathway * Funding requirements * Competitive Analysis * Business Model  2. Evaluation and Investment Decision: During this step, PIF staff conducts extensive diligence to assess the strength of the proposed business in relation to our investment criteria. This process takes place over 3 to 6 months during which time we interact with technical and market experts, possible customers, competitors and potential co-investors as we prepare for presentation of the investment opportunity to our external Investment Committee for final approval. The team will work with investigators and their advisors to develop a project or business plan including connections to potential entrepreneurs, advisors and investors in the venture, private or corporate arena. Venture Launch / Ongoing Support: Once an investment has been approved, the Innovation Fund plays an active role in the ongoing development of the new venture. The team will work on all aspects required to move the new entity forward including recruiting senior management and staff, providing guidance and support in technology development, serving on the Board of Directors and working with management to achieve milestones.",6/26/2015,"Biotechnology, Finance",,,,0,0,0,370

High-volume / low-margin products, such as essential vaccines, are also of significant interest.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration,7,"Silver Spring, Maryland, United States","FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nationâ€:tm:s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and more affordable and by helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. FDA also has responsibility for regulating the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. Finally, FDA plays a significant role in the Nationâ€:tm:s counterterrorism capability. FDA fulfills this responsibility by ensuring the security of the food supply and by fostering development of medical products to respond to deliberate and naturally emerging public health threats. History The Food and Drug Administration is the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency in the U. S. federal government. Its origins can be traced back to the appointment of Lewis Caleb Beck in the Patent Office around 1848 to carry out chemical analyses of agricultural products, a function that the newly created Department of Agriculture inherited in 1862. Although it was not known by its present name until 1930, FDAâ€:tm:s modern regulatory functions began with the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, a law a quarter-century in the making that prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated and misbranded food and drugs. Harvey Washington Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, had been the driving force behind this law and headed its enforcement in the early years, providing basic elements of protection that consumers had never known before that time. The FDA and its responsibilities have undergone a metamorphosis since 1906. Similarly, the marketplace itself, the sciences undergirding the products the agency regulates, and the social, cultural, political, and economic changes that have formed the context for these developments, all have witnessed upheavals over the past century. Yet the core public health mission of the agency remains now as it did then. This web site features a variety of portals that offer insight into these changes, from overviews on how consumer protection laws evolved, to case studies that explore and interpret the agencyâ€:tm:s work and policies. In addition, the visitor will find links to key related web sites as well as citations to valuable sources to help understand the history of FDA.",,"Cosmetics, Health Care, Medical",,,,0,0,0,370
